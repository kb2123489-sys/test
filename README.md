## 🌍 Introduction

**NetPulse** is an intelligent internet event analyzer powered by search grounding. It transforms scattered web information into structured insights, providing real-time summaries, core impact analysis, and historical context comparisons for major tech and internet events.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Search Grounding**: Utilizes **Tavily API** to fetch real-time, accurate context from the web, reducing hallucinations.
- **Deep Analysis**: Powered by **Gemini 3 Pro** (via OpenAI-compatible proxy) to generate professional journalistic summaries.
- **Historical Echoes**: Unique feature that compares current events with historical precedents to find patterns.
- **Responsive UI**: A modern, glassmorphism-inspired interface built with **Tailwind CSS**, optimized for mobile and desktop.
- **Secure Architecture**: Implements secure API calls using HTTP Headers (Bearer Token) instead of URL parameters.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons)
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini 3 Pro Preview (accessed via OpenAI-compatible interface)
- **Search**: Tavily AI Search API
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+) or Bun
- A **Tavily API Key** (for search)
- A **Gemini API Key** (or a proxy key supporting OpenAI format)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/netpulse.git
   cd netpulse
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
